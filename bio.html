						<h1>About Me</h1>
                            <p>Ulysses “Jesus” Browning was birthed in the frigid winter of 1980 on January 22nd. Born and raised in a Texan family, Ulysses naturally grew up with a heart of fiery patriotism. While in attending his poorly funded high school, Ulysses took it upon himself to work two full time jobs in order to fund his high school’s JROTC program. Not only did he fund his high school’s JROTC program, he did that while simultaneously running its SGA as class president. After graduating from Warren G. Harding High School as Valedictorian of his class, he was later accepted into West Point with seven U.S. senator nominations, both in and out of state.
</p>
<p>Ulysses Browning would later graduate top of his class at West Point. After his time at West Point, Ulysses would go on to serve in the Gulf War, the Balkans War (where he single-handedly brought down the Yugoslavian regime), the War in Iraq, and the War in Afghanistan. Throughout his 26 year military career he served as a Second Lieutenant in both the 101st and 82nd Airborne Division, JSOC Sergeant First Class, Squad Leader Alpha of Seal Team 8, Fireteam Leader Oscar of Seal Team 7, MARSOC Division Charlie Leader. In addition, he served as a Marine Raider and Recon, Green Beret, Company Fox Squad Leader Charlie, an F-4 Phantom II Pilot, and 2nd Brigadier Lieutenant General of the 75th Ranger Regiment First Battalion.
</p>
<p>After retiring from his extensive military career, Ulysses J. Browning found himself watching CNN and witnessing the corruption of establishment politics and mainstream media. After displaying a fiery burst of enragement, by painting a world-class depiction of Jesus Christ on a 17 inch silk canvas, Ulysses “Jesus” Browning declared war on politics in Capitol Hill and he’s in it to win it.
